Welcome to the Perseus documentation! Here, you'll find guides on how to use Perseus, as well as documentation for specific features and plenty of examples! Note that every code snippet in this book comes from something in the [examples](https://github.com/framesurge/perseus/tree/main/examples), where you can get context from real-world code.
